<h1>DeSales University Application</h1>

 ### [Video Demonstration](https://vimeo.com/1147171206?share=copy&fl=sv&fe=ci)

<h2>Description</h2>
The DeSales App project was created to help students navigate and access information relevant to DeSales with a simple and easy to navigate UI. This in response to DeSales University having no dedicated app for students and students having to traverse through a varity of links to access the information they are looking for. Within the application, the user is able to see the live dinning menu and see what is available throughout the day along with their personal grades and schedule. The dinning information is retrieved via a web scraper class which parses live meal options hosted on DeSales' Sodexo website. The grades and class schedules, however, can only be parsed through .txt files due to security and privacy reasons; these fields must be manually entered by the user/student as we do not have the means to the API key.
